                    <p class="description">Here’s some redesign work on the old croc dragon, working it over to fit into the Ray world. It’s a wingless, heavily scaled, semi-aquatic predator in direct competition with the Salmon dragon. It preys upon, and is simultaneously preyed upon by the salmon. Eats plenty of things smaller than it and will hit salmons (and other larger, soft-bellied things) from below with the bayonet chin. Salmons, on the other hand, have the four arm set up to pin and rend while the wicked hooked beaks pry away armor to get to the tender bits.</p>

                <p class="description">These guys are telepathic gliding things, quite clever and dexterous. Started out as pretty hardcore conquerors, and a ways into their space travels engaged a couple other races they stumbled upon that were trying to work out a peace treaty with each other. Long story short, all turned into a giant four way cluster that ended abruptly when the Locks showed up. The four races eventually became the founding stock of Empire Eutharious.</p>
